Suan Ni Home Guard

* Components

** Camera events

Wait for events from Synology, attach metadata, and pass them to
`suanni/events/motion/camera`

** Motion events

Get a list of presence sensors from `zigbee2mqtt`, and listen to them for
events. Attach metadata, and pass to `suanni/events/motion/sensor`

** Object detector

Watches all events on `suanni/events/motion/#`, and if there's an attached
location, attempts to take a snapshot from the nearby cameras, analyzing them
for objects. When objects are detected, post the results to
`suanni/events/object_detection`.

** Home assistant bridge

Listen for objects on `suanni/events/object_detection`, and forward events on to
a Home Assistant binary sensor.
